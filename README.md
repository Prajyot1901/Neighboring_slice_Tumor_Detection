To test the results given in the manuscript, Follow the instructions.
1) Download the codes.
2) Download the model weights provided in the release.
3) Download the training data from the link. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation
4) Run both the codes in dataprocessing for all three modalities seperately after changing the paths in the codes to the original paths of T1, T2 and FLAIR one at a time.
5) Now, run the testing files after changing the paths to the original paths. Here, note that you have to change paths to the saved model weights as well.
